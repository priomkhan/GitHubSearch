# GitHubSearch
Project Requirements:

Building an Android application that is able to search through GitHub users and their
corresponding projects using the GitHub api: https://developer.github.com/v3/ using Kotlin. 
The application shall contain 2 screens.

The first screen will contain a search bar that can search through any user on the GitHub website
at the top with a list of results underneath. Each item should contain the avatar image, username,
and the number of repositories they have. The list view shall not be paginated. Additionally, the
search will automatically update upon each letter entered.

Tapping on a user will bring up a screen that contains the profile details of that user. The view
should contain their avatar image, username, number of followers, number of following,
biography, email, location, join date, and a list of public repositories with a search bar at the top.
Each item of the list view shall contain the name of the repository, the number of stars, and the
number of forks. The search bar will allow the user to search through the user’s repository. The
list view shall not be paginated. Additionally, the search will automatically update upon each
letter entered.

Tapping on a repository shall bring the user to a web browser and open the repository in the
GitHub website.
You shall be given 24 hours to complete this task.
The application will be used during the interview, please be ready to explain and defend your
choices for technologies and coding paradigms.
The application shall be hosted on your own GitHub. Also make sure that the application
completely works before submitting it.
Bonus Points:
• All results should be cached such that when going back, the results should be still be
displayed on the previous screen.
• Get infinite scrolling working for the first screen.
• Add a way to sign in.
• Anything that displays your mastery over Android Studio, Kotlin, and the understanding
of the documentation.
